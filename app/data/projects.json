We utilized SHARP parameter data and Line-of-Sight Magnetogram images from 2010-2017, balancing the dataset with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to address data imbalance. Various machine learning models, including a Transformer for time-series data, were tested and compared to previous models to enhance prediction results.",
